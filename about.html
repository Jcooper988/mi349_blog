    <p>My name is Jasper and I am from Chicago, IL. I currently go to Michigan <br>
        State Univeristy. My major is Media and Information and I have a minor in Entrepreneurship.<br>
        MY goal for my life is to get a job in Web development and then from my first job,<br>
        I will start working to save up money to open up my own Website business. <br>
        I want to work my way up through my career to become a top level Web developer <br>
        and possibly move on from Web development to other areas of technology.<br>
        I have gained experience in Web development from doing one internship last <br>
        Spring. During this internship , I worked in Wordpress and had the opportunity <br>
        to explore the different things I could do with it. I also believe that <br>
        Web development could be another passion in my life. I started to find <br>
        out whether or not Web development could be a passion of mine when i first <br>
        started to learn to code on codeacademy. <br>
    </p>

    <p>What I value the most in my life is new experiences, family and building <br>
        on my self improvement of myself. I have always had a vision of becoming <br>
        the best version of myself and I decided to take action to accomplish  that. <br>
        I plan to build my self up financially through my career of becoming and <br>
        then being a Web developer.  I may not be in a good financial position <br>
        now but eventually with hardwork and patience , I will be in the <br> 
        position that I want to be. Family has been important to me because <br>
        family has been one of the reasons why I have grown up to be a hardworking man <br>
        and a guy who constantly wants to evolve to be the best.<br>
